Retinol is a strong ingredient and your skin may take a week or two to get used to it. I had a mild break out and some dry skin while using it during the first 2 weeks. After that went away I started noticing how my skin tone had evened out. At 12 weeks lines were much less noticeable ( even those darn crows feet) and skin felt smoother. It's important to use a daily SPF 30 moisturizer with this. I am very pleased and will buy more Roc products.</review_full></review><review><review_number>9</review_number><author_name>lily</author_name><author_location>fl</author_location><review_date>3/5/2012</review_date><brand_affinity>brand buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>Works for me!</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros>Easy To Use

As a "California Girl" and sun worshipper (sans sunscreen) while in my teens, I have some pretty serious sun damage issues.

As I approach my 70th birthday (!) I can honestly say that my skin looks better than it did when I approached my last "big" birthday.

I have tried so many other products that haven't fulfilled their promises.

The pores are tightening and the scars are not as deep as they used to be. I will continue to use it! You do need to limit sun exposure when using this product. You may notice some slight redness or peeling when you first start using it, but that's normal and actually a sign that its working. This goes away after a day or two of use.</review_full></review><review><review_number>42</review_number><author_name>lola glittercheeks</author_name><author_location>gainesville, fl</author_location><review_date>12/15/2009</review_date><brand_affinity>brand buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>Use religiously</short_review><review_stars>5.0</review_stars><pros>Easy To Use

It is a bit more expensive than I normally spend. I don't buy department store products. Have used most drugstore products except this one, and most recently Avon. Have always liked Alpha Hydrox products and use fairly religiously as I have combination skin and occasional acne. I used this product twice a day, morning and night, and it lasted about six weeks. Just bought four more. I like the way it tightens and gently exfoliates.</review_full></review><review><review_number>45</review_number><author_name>cici</author_name><author_location>midwest</author_location><review_date>11/14/2009</review_date><brand_affinity>brand buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>Good Product</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros>Easy To Use

I have used Avon, Clinique, Origins, Bioelements, etc. products in the past. I decided to try this brand because I wasn't seeing the results I wanted with my Avon wrinkle cream. I have been using this with the other Roc products such as the moisturizer and nighttime stuff. At first my skin was a little red, but after the first application it never did that again. My skin is usually not sensitive, but can be to retinol products. If you are sensitive to retinol, I would not use this. Overall, I think it is working pretty good. My fine lines, although not gone by any means, are smoothed out in appearance and less noticable. This works great before the daytime moisturizer, which I am in love with. I hope after the 8 weeks are up I'll see even better results. I'd recommend anyone trying this who likes big brand names, it works just as good or better!</review_full></review><review><review_number>46</review_number><author_name>annie</author_name><author_location>nyc, ny</author_location><review_date>9/29/2009</review_date><brand_affinity>budget buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>FORMER FASHION MODEL SHARES HER VIEW</short_review><review_stars>5.0</review_stars><pros>Easy To Use

I do not have deep wrinkles, but I was hoping this product would help improve the clarity and appearance of my skin. It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling, but it is very heavily perfumed.

My kids and friends tell me how young I look, and my girlfriends are all using Roc now, and love it too. Wrinkles are no more with Roc. The retinol they use in it is an amazing little secret I never knew about.

I used this product for about 9 months and while the texture was good, I'm not sure I saw any noticeable results. The size of the container is good for travel, and it has a practical lid. But, like several other ROC products I've purchased, the fragrance is unappealing. In fact, the smell of this particular product seemed to get worse over time. Because of this factor, I ended up throwing it away before it was all used up.</review_full></review><review><review_number>85</review_number><author_name>sean the product junkie</author_name><author_location>nyc</author_location><review_date>11/6/2008</review_date><brand_affinity>brand buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>Good Serum</short_review><review_stars>3.0</review_stars><pros>Easy To Use

It's not greasy and doesn't break out my skin.My fine lines have started to disappear after just using it for about 3 weeks. It stings a bit after I've used my scrub so if you have sensitive skin,you might want to start out using it every other day. It does not leave my skin red or irritated.
