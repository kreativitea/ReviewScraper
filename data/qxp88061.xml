I had dark spots, a forehead furrow that became longer and deeper every day, lines around my mouth, blotches, open pores and dry skin. I decided to try this one because of the great reviews. On the second day of trying this I saw that my blotchy skin looked much more brighter and softer, my fine lines however looked awful until 7 days later when the lines on my forehead were pretty much gone. I use this only at night time and I do put a night time moisturizer over it. During the day I use an SPF moisturizer. After 2 weeks my skin had so dramatically improved, I actually saw my younger blemish free skin back. Never thought that would happen. I need less make-up during the day now.

Bedtime</best_uses><review_full>As the years start piling on, I have tried many creams to help my skin appear younger and also to be healthier. I am a smoker, which I know does awful things to my skin. I finally tried RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream. I immediately felt it working on my skin with its slight burning sensation, which I deduced was sloughing off the dead, wrinkly skin.

I knew I might have a winner at that point. So, instead of continuing to waste money on products that I felt were not working, I used my old moisturizing cream on one side of my face and RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream on the other side of my face for 3 months. Yes, THREE MONTHS, to make sure I really knew if I had a product that worked.

On Easter of this year, I attended the usual family gathering, and I asked my friends and family if they could see less defined wrinkles on one side of my face versus the other. Almost everyone chose the side with the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream as the side with lesser wrinkles. (The two who didn't select that side were not wearing their glasses and I surmise that they were just guessing, like it was a guessing game.)

I have been using it every day since, and on both sides of my face. IT REALLY WORKS WELL FOR ME! It is not a miracle cream, and no creams are! However, I and everyone I know really did see results of less defined wrinkles!

P.S. The Roc Retinol day cream with the 30 SPF does not feel like it works as well, and the burning sensation is not as intense, so I am guessing that it is not as potent at the night cream.</review_full></review><review><review_number>20</review_number><author_name>srgb</author_name><author_location>columbus, ohio</author_location><review_date>6/9/2010</review_date><brand_affinity>budget buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>Working</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros>Absorbs Quickly

Global Economic Issues has forced me to really compare products and found that Derma-e Vitamin A Retinyl Wrinkle Creme is just as good and at less than $12 for 4 oz is a much smarter choice - good economy or bad. Compare ingredients! I do also like Roc Deep Wrinkle formula but honestly, neither will fade age-spots - that's another product by Boots #7. Roc does help soften the look of lines and entire face for a smoother, more youthful look but until they can either drop the price or give 8 oz or more for the price they charge today, the competition wins and so do I!</review_full></review><review><review_number>25</review_number><author_name>misslcwestbrook</author_name><author_location>balad, iraq</author_location><review_date>5/4/2010</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>Skin Therapy</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros>Absorbs Quickly

Friends and co-workers attribute my healthier complexion to lots of healthy eating and exercise (both of which started months ago).

Every morning</best_uses><review_full>After trying many products to reduce my forehead wrinkles, especially the squinchy lines between my eyebrows, I tried the Roc Retinol Correxion cream. It caused a little redness the first two days, but then I saw a reduction in the wrinkles within a few weeks. I use it just on the lines every morning under a deep hydration cream and then a layer of sunscreen. (Always use a good sunscreen with a retinol product.) Even in the dry winter air, it works.</review_full></review><review><review_number>40</review_number><author_name>sydney</author_name><author_location>salisbury, md</author_location><review_date>12/26/2009</review_date><brand_affinity>brand buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>Effective and cheap</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros>Absorbs Quickly

I did experience a slight tingling upon initial few uses. I also experienced some initial purging which I experience with all retinoid products. Both of these have dissipated after about two weeks. My skin is definitely brighter and although i haven't seen much softening of lines, I believe that comes with longer use (4-12 weeks). This stuff is pretty potent, so if you're not use to the retinoid type products, please go slowly. You only need a tiny bit and every other night or 2-3 night a week may be sufficient. I'm overall very pleased with this product and look forward to continued use and continued improvements. I received a sample of this product as a BzzAgent.</review_full></review><review><review_number>41</review_number><author_name>dewittmama</author_name><author_location>michigan</author_location><review_date>12/24/2009</review_date><brand_affinity>budget buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>P.U.</short_review><review_stars>2.0</review_stars><pros>Goes On Smoothly

It absorbs quickly and I love the feeling of my skin when I wake up in the morning-- soft and glowy-- but it's hard for me to tell if it's a heavy enough moisturizer. Sometimes, I think that it might not be heavy enough-- I live in NYC so I can't tell if maybe air is particularly dry because of winter and typical apartment heat.

As for whether it does what it says-- i.e. make wrinkles disappear-- hard to say. I got it mainly to get rid of a deepening wrinkle on my forehead and it's still there, but maybe it's fading...(or maybe that's wishful thinking). Bottom line, I like this product a lot, but I'm not in love with it (I am in love with it's daytime sibling). Still, it's one of the better night time moisturizers I've tried and like I said, I do wake up with great looking skin. BTW, I haven't experienced any of the breakout problems others have reported.

I have used other so called wrinkle correction and moisturizing creams recently because in addition to aging (yipes! 58) I have also lost a tremendous amount of weight which made the wrinkles even more noticable. The only product that made the slightest difference was Loreal and I had used their line of "Age Perfect" faithfully for over a month. I decided to give this cream a try but I had no confidence in it and actually thought I was wasting more money. Well, I'll tell you that after one night I could see a visable improvement! One night! This product is unbelievable! The fragrance is light, very pleasant, and quickly dissapates so, even though some others have complained, I LIKE the fragrance and I am telling you that if you use this product as directed you will not be disappointed. I am going to get the entire line of products. I am normally a sceptic and pretty hard to please and have NEVER written a review of ANYthing but this stuff really works and has made a believer out of me.</review_full></review><review><review_number>76</review_number><author_name>janeen</author_name><author_location>big rapids mi</author_location><review_date>1/10/2009</review_date><brand_affinity>budget buyer</brand_affinity><short_review>A good night cream</short_review><review_stars>3.0</review_stars><pros>Absorbs Quickly

There is a very slight non-offensive odor, but who CARES! You're only suppossed to be using this product while you sleep anyway.

Also, with every other product I've used (regardless of how expensive)they've caused my skin to break out. The skin on my face is very sensitive and has a tendency to break out easily. Not so with the Roc product! In fact, it's helped my complexion to be blemish free!!

I'm absolutely delighted with this product, and will be a very loyal customer.

For anyone who has problems with dryness, it says on the package instructions to alternate use with moisturizer. Basically, common sense solutions.

Highly recommended.</review_full></review><review><review_number>83</review_number><author_name>anonymous</author_name><author_location>seattle</author_location><review_date>5/13/2008</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>I use this product as a ...</short_review><review_stars>3.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>I use this product as a dab treatment on some of my beginning horizontal forehead lines.

I spend a lot of time outdoors and my skin was really starting to show it, particularly in winter. After using this regularly, for just a couple of weeks, my forehead furrows have not changed, but the smaller lines on my cheeks and around the mouth have decreased drastically. I was using a very expensive moisturizer (starts with Stri-), which caused acne and cysts underneath the skin. It was also greasy, while this is NOT. RoC does not clog the pores, as so many moisturizers do. There is a pleasant tingle when applied (the scent isn't all that pleasant, but I don't find it very noticeable after a few minutes). This also lasts for quite a while, since a little goes a long way. It's affordable, particularly compared to some of the other brands out there. It may not work for everyone but it's the first product I've tried, in a long time, which actually showed results.</review_full></review><review><review_number>92</review_number><author_name>samantha</author_name><author_location>boca raton, fl</author_location><review_date>10/14/2007</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>I like this product.

I started to use the RoC, but I put the sticky side of a band aid over the wrinkle after I've applied the cream, before bed. Well, after two days the wrinkle was GONE! I know it sounds nuts, but I am absolutely flabbergasted myself. Don't use the part of the band-aid with the cloth on it-it will absorb the cream and it won't absorb into the wrinkle. A true miracle and I look YEARS younger. I think the band-aid trick might work with other moisturizers as well. PS I have very oily skin with much enlarged pores. I experienced no sensitivity from this product whatsoever. Try it!</review_full></review><review><review_number>118</review_number><author_name>meagan</author_name><author_location>undisclosed</author_location><review_date>3/7/2005</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>I work in the medical ...</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>I work in the medical field, and this product was "unofficially" recommended to me on several occasions, so I chose to try it and I have been very pleased. In regard to previous reviews, please note that most dermatologists recommend that when introducing a product such as this into your regimen, you start by only applying it EVERY THIRD DAY (or, in this case, night) and once skin adjusts (after about one to two weeks) EVERY OTHER DAY and once skin adjusts again EVERY DAY. I personally began with every-other-day applications and now apply daily but always top with a light moisturizer. My skin has definitely smoothed and my skin tone has definitely evened out since I began using this product two months ago, (I am less than half way through my first tube). I am giving this product only 4 stars because I reserve 5 stars for miracles, and regarding skin the only products that perform "miracles" are usually prescribed and accompanied by procedures. This is, however, an EXCELLENT product.</review_full></review><review><review_number>119</review_number><author_name>anonymous</author_name><author_location>undisclosed</author_location><review_date>2/15/2005</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>I actually find this ...</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>I actually find this product very good. Even after the first application, my skin looked much smoother! Its too early to say whether it'll do what it says it will do in the long run, but so far, so good. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because my skin feels quite dry and tight when the product is on my face.</review_full></review><review><review_number>120</review_number><author_name>rebecca</author_name><author_location>mount laurel, nj</author_location><review_date>1/30/2005</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>Be very careful if you ...</short_review><review_stars>1.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>Be very careful if you have even mildly sensitive skin.

I first started using this product along with the Roc Age Diminishing Daily Moisturizer. Within a week or so I looked like "the keeper of the crypt." My face was red, blotchy and had little flakes and dry wrinkles. However, due to all the positive reviews of this product I wanted to persevere. I started mixing each product with equal amounts of my old moisturizer. This helped a lot. A month later, I no longer have the redness and flaking. My skin feels and looks good. I will say though, I do not see the remarkable wrinkle reduction that I had expected.</review_full></review><review><review_number>124</review_number><author_name>belann</author_name><author_location>marietta, ga</author_location><review_date>1/6/2005</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>The reason this gets one ...</short_review><review_stars>1.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>The reason this gets one star is only because I have super sensitive skin and although I only used a very small amount, I actually have red dots on my face.

Obviously, it works great on the right skin.</review_full></review><review><review_number>125</review_number><author_name>jp</author_name><author_location>aurora, co</author_location><review_date>12/27/2004</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>AMAZING!

It has seriously taken 10 YEARS off my face!! Now I buy it 3 tubes at a time so I never run out. Sometimes I get a little sensitivity around the eye area so I lay off for a day or two around the eyes, but keep putting it on the rest of my face. The most amazing product I've ever tried. I only use the night cream, then use an SPF 15 during the day.

I have tried other, more expensive wrinkle creams -- plus I have used Retin-A. This RoC night cream does the job for a fraction of the price, and very quickly, I should add. I noticed a difference in my 50-year-old skin tone and age spots within a full week, and continue to see improvements. It stings at first, but as another reviewer said here, stick with it and you won't be sorry (unless you have especially sensitive skin). I will look for other products by the same company in the future.</review_full></review><review><review_number>127</review_number><author_name>anonymous</author_name><author_location>undisclosed</author_location><review_date>11/3/2004</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>I am 42 and have sun ...</short_review><review_stars>5.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>I am 42 and have sun damage on my cheeks and under my eyes, and crow's feet from my expressive face.

I have been using it for 3 months now and I can see a big difference. I'm 39 and have some lines and puffiness around my eyes. It definitely helps with wrinkles, not so much with puffiness though. I gave it 5 stars because it really works and at such a low price. A word of caution: It is so potent that after using it the first 3 nights it caused a dry, red rash with some swelling (sort of like a sunburn). After it healed, I had to gradually get my skin used to it over the course of 3 to 4 weeks (once per week, then twice, then every other day, etc.) and I don't usually have sensitive skin. I have not had any problems with it since.</review_full></review><review><review_number>130</review_number><author_name>paulina</author_name><author_location>undisclosed</author_location><review_date>6/5/2004</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>Everyone should be using ...</short_review><review_stars>5.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>Everyone should be using a retinol at night, and this product is AMAZING. Within a week, I have noticed a remarkable reduction in my crow's feet and wrinkles around the mouth. I am 32 and have worshiped the sun my whole life. This product is to get rid of wrinkles, not a heavy night moisturizer, so I still apply my Burt's Bees carrot night cream over this. Retinol is powerful stuff, so I am only using this a few nights a week. There is some redness and tingling involved. No pain, no gain! I am truly surprised at how good the results have been with this wrinkle cream, well worth the money.</review_full></review><review><review_number>131</review_number><author_name>anonymous</author_name><author_location>undisclosed</author_location><review_date>4/15/2004</review_date><brand_affinity /><short_review>I only gave it 4 stars, ...</short_review><review_stars>4.0</review_stars><pros /><cons /><best_uses /><review_full>I only gave it 4 stars, because I have only been using it for 1 week and the box claims "12 weeks to younger skin". BUT, in this 1 week I have definitely seen a difference. I'm 36 and have just started to see the more serious skin/wrinkle problems start, like if I sleep on one side of my face, the line by my eye stays all day! This Roc product has really improved that. I believe that if I keep using it, that line may disappear completely.</review_full></review></reviews></product></root>
